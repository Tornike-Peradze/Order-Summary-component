## Overview

This is a solution to the [Order summary card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj). It aims to create a visually appealing and visually as close as possible to the original order summary component.

### The challenge

- Setting up the basic HTML structure with appropriate tags and attributes.
- Styling the background image and color to create an engaging visual experience.
- Creating the main container and applying styles such as dimensions, border radius, and positioning.
- Incorporating the provided images and text elements, aligning them correctly within the container.
- Styling the main heading and paragraph with the appropriate fonts, sizes, and colors.
- Designing the middle section of the card with the music icon, plan details, and price information.
- Adding interactivity to the middle section by applying hover effects to enhance user experience.

## My process

### Built with

This project was built using the following technologies and tools:

- HTML: Used for creating the structure and elements of the web page.
  CSS: Applied styles to enhance the visual presentation and layout of the order summary card.
- Visual Studio Code: A powerful and popular code editor that provided a convenient and efficient development environment.
- Frontend Mentor: The project was completed as part of a challenge provided by Frontend Mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io/). Frontend Mentor offers a range of real-life coding challenges to help developers practice their skills and improve their front-end development abilities.

### What I learned

Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable knowledge and skills. Here are some key things I learned:

- Utilizing flexbox: I deepened my understanding of flexbox and its powerful capabilities for creating responsive layouts. I applied flexbox to achieve proper alignment and spacing of elements within the card component.

- Managing div relationships: I learned how to structure and organize div elements to establish the desired relationships between different sections of the card component. This allowed me to create a logical hierarchy and improve the overall structure of the HTML code.

- CSS Positioning: Leveraging CSS positioning properties such as absolute and relative, you were able to precisely position elements within the card. This technique allowed you to create the overlay effect for the music icon and position the "Change" text and price information appropriately.

### Continued development

I aspire to dive deeper into CSS and explore more advanced techniques and concepts. This includes mastering CSS Grid, learning CSS animations and transitions, and exploring responsive design patterns to create truly dynamic and interactive user interfaces. With the increasing use of mobile devices, it's crucial to create websites that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes. I want to focus on mastering responsive design principles and adopting a mobile-first approach, ensuring that my projects are accessible and provide a great user experience across all devices.
